# 2.0.0

Quantum 2.0 is a brand new engine, so we recommend the developer to start by reading this document (also included in the SDK): quick-start-guide.md

Because the internal the sub-systems (navigation, physics, etc) and its components were either kept or evolved from the versions found in 1.2.4.x, all release notes from previous versions are included bellow.

**Breaking Changes:**

We merged the code and systems project into a single csproj called `quantum.code` :o

Migrate your project by copying the `quantum.code` folder from the **SDK** and copy all of your custom files (from state and systems) into that project: Add the new code project to your Visual Studio solution and drag drop the files there. Also copy your *.User files and CommandSetup.cs and SystemSetup.cs. Afterwards you can delete the state and systems projects completely.

We combined all source code provided with the SDK that is inside quantum code solution into a single file called `Core.cs` to make the upgrade more managable in the future (e.g. adding and removing files).

### Build 263 (Apr 27, 2020)

**Breaking Changes:**

Bake all navmeshes again.

The NavMeshAgent component has been split up into different parts. We noticed that developers working with navmesh and steering want to control quite a lot of the final movement result, which makes sense, because it is often so vital to the game experience. The new navmesh agent parts should help developers to easily pick a combination of navmesh support without losing multi-threaded performance and without executing unneeded parts.

**NavMeshPathfinder** has a target position, perfors the actual path-finding, stores a user-defined number of waypoints and detects the waypoint progression.

**NavMeshSteeringAgent** (requires a NavMeshPathfinder component) has max speed, acceleration and rotation speed and steers the entity along the path. Apart from not using this component developers can change the `MovementType` to `Callback` and inject their own movement while having  to date avoidance data.
The speed integration has been changed slightly to work more reliable when angular speed is used. Disable rotation speed and acceleration by setting them to 0.

**NavMeshAvoidanceAgent** (requires both the NavMeshPathfinder and the NavMeshSteeringAgent components) integrates HRVO agent avoidance. Avoidance priorities work now the same way as in Unity. Additionally type and masks can be defined to filter out who can avoid whom.

```(csharp)
// new agent component creation
var entity = f.Create();
f.Set(c, NavMeshPathfinder.Create(frame, entity, navMeshAgentConfig));
f.Set(entity, new NavMeshSteeringAgent()); // optional
f.Set(entity, new NavMeshAvoidanceAgent()); // optional
```

- The `NavMeshAgentConfig` asset has not changed much and it still includes data for all navigation components
- The pathfinder is the only component that requires an explict config asset during the creation. The config file, though, is applied to both other components.
- The config can be updated during run-time using `NavMeshPathfinder.SetConfig()` on the pathfinder component
- The number of waypoints stored with the pathfinder can be set under `NavMeshAgentConfig.WaypointCount`
- `NavMeshAgentConfig.AvoidanceRadius` is now only used when `OverrideAvoidanceRadius` is enabled
- `NavMeshAgentConfig.WaypointDetectionDistance` was changed into `EnableWaypointDetection`and two subsequent values (see API docs or tooltips for more information)
- `NavMeshAgentConfig.SteeringCallback` has been removed. Instead the `ISignalOnNavMeshMoveAgent` signal should be used to advance the agent position
- Merged `SimulationConfig.AvoidanceCallbacks` and `SteeringCallbacks` into `NavigationCallbacks`. Reset the value when you are using the callbacks
- Importantly all navigation callbacks are now called from the main-thread and are secure for developers to use

```(csharp)
// simplified movement callback
public void OnNavMeshMoveAgent(Frame f, EntityRef entity, FPVector2 desiredDirection) {
var agent = f.Unsafe.GetPointer<NavMeshSteeringAgent>(entity);
var transform = f.Unsafe.GetPointer<Transform2D>(entity);
transform->Position = transform->Position + desiredDirection * f.DeltaTime*
transform->Rotation = FPVector2.RadiansSignedSkipNormalize(FPVector2.Up, desiredDirection);
```

- Added a navmesh utility method to generate a random position on the navmesh (FindRandomPointOnNavmesh)
- Added navmesh baking parameter object (MapNavMeshBakeData) to enable custom raw navmesh input data
- Fixed all navigation callbacks to be called from the main thread
- Fixed an issue with navmesh agent start position glitches by using a more elaborate nearest triangle search algorithm
- Fixed compilation errors in the QuantumToolbarUtilities class when using with Unity 2020
- Fixed Scene prototypes can now have views set to assets
- Navmesh links utilize the region system to be toggled on and off on the map level as well for agents. Add a `MapNavMeshRegion` script to the `OffMeshLink` Unity script.
- Removed INavMeshRegionMask interface and replaced it with a NavMeshRegionMask struct that is saved in globals and on the PathfinderAgent

```(csharp)
// old
f.Map.SetNavMeshRegionActive(f, "secret", false);
// new
var secret = f.Map.RegionMap["secret"];
f.NavMeshRegionMask->ToggleRegion(secret, false);
```

### Build 261 (Apr 24, 2020)

### Build 256 (Apr 23, 2020)

- Added concrete RotationFreezeFlags.None as default flag (it was implicit before)
- Added TaskProfiler shift+wheel increases/decreases graph's maximum value
- Added TaskProfiler source client selection
- Fixed an issue with 3D static colliders data without collider ID and trigger state assigned
- The Core.PhysicsSystem has been split into PhysicsSystem2D and PhysicsSystem3D, and we now have a CullingSystem2D and 3D. All of these can be enabled/disabled at will now.

**Breaking Changes:**

- Renamed `Frame.EntityExists()` to `Frame.Exists()`
- Delete `quantum\_unity\Assets\Photon\Quantum\Assemblies\quantum.state*`
- Delete `quantum\_unity\Assets\Photon\Quantum\Assemblies\quantum.systems*`
- Delete `quantum\_unity\Assets\Photon\Quantum\Editor\TaskProfiler\QuantumTaskProfilerWindow.Data.cs`
- The 2D and 3D physics callbacks systems have been reworked. To upgrade, make sure you:

1) Update the callback **flags** used: 

- The `FrameBase.Physics2D.SetCallbacks(CallbackFlags)` API (as the correspondent on the Physics3D) is still available, but the overload with booleans has been removed.
- Make sure you set the flag for the callbacks you want to receive with bitwise operations.
- All previous flags (Collision, Static, OnEnter, etc) have been replaced by a set of 12 new flags: 3 flags for dynamic collisions (OnDynamicCollision, OnDynamicCollisionEnter, OnDynamicCollisionExit), and, analogously, 3 for static collisions, dynamic triggers and static triggers.

2) Update the callback **signals** used:

- All previous collisions signals have been replaced by 6 for each physics engine.
- For 2D Physics collisions, for example, you now have: ISignalOnCollision2D, ISignalOnCollisionEnter2D and ISignalOnCollisionExit2D. Analogously, you have 3 signals for 2D trigger collisions (OnTrigger2D), and the respective signals on the 3D Physics (just replace 2D for 3D).
- Notice that ISignalOnCollision2D will be called if the entity has the OnDynamicCollision AND/OR the OnStaticCollision flag. Use the `IsStatic` property on the collision info to differentiate between them. This is also true for the trigger signals.
- Last but not least, the generic `CollisionInfo`	struct has been replaced by `CollisionInfo2D` (collision and enter signals), `TriggerInfo2D` (trigger and enter signals), `ExitInfo2D` (exit signals) and their 3D physics respectives.

# 1.2.4.2

## RC1 (Apr 22, 2020)

**Breaking Changes:**

The setup of NavMesh regions quickly reaches the 64 count limit when working with multiple navmeshes per map. 
With this update the regions are now merged and saved on the map asset and shared over all navmeshes. The new behavior can be disabled by enabling Map.UseLegacyRegionOffsets.

Re-baking of all maps and navmeshes is required.

Select each agent config in the Editor once to initialize the avoidance radius setting.
UsePhysics has been removed from NavMeshAgentConfig. Set the new option `Move Agent By` to `Transform` (UsePhysics off) or `DynamicBody` (UsePhysics on).

- Fixed navmesh regions with multiple navmeshes in one map. The region names are now merged into one list on the map and are controlled via the map API (SetNavMeshRegionActive).
- Fixed an issue that prevented the navmesh agent steering from being applied to Transform3D or DynamicBody3D and changed the navmesh agent filter to make Transform2D and DynamicBody part of the Any block while also adding the 3D components
- Fixed an issue that caused a glitch in navmesh agent steering (speed was set to 0 for one tick) when reaching a waypoint.
- Fixed an issue that created unnecessary waypoints that were very close together.
- Fixed an issue that caused navmesh agent steering glitches during re-pathing (due to not having a valid target for one or more ticks). An additional waypoint is cached on the agent that is only used during re-pathing.
- Fixed an issue with initial clock-guessing during input-based reconnects.
- Fixed an issue that resets the Quantum AnimatorGraph asset guid when pressing Import.
- Fixed an issue with the index range check done on Map.GetStaticCollider3D.
- Fixed an issue that caused 3D ray casts not to consider the layer mask when checking against static meshes.
- Fixed an issue with the AOT file generation when member have the same names.
- Fixed DynamicBody3D.Torque not being reset every tick by the 3D Physics engine.
- Fixed an issue with the rotation interpolation that was causing rotation teleports on the view objects.
- Fixed an issue with the AnimatorGraph asset when deserializing from Json (desync, exceptions).
- Fixed an issue with the computation of sphere-sphere collision penetration.
- Fixed an issue with the gizmos drawing of static spheres attached to GameObjects with scale different than 1.
- Fixed an issue with the mesh baking process that could cause FPVector3 overflows.
- Improved the experimental avoidance quality for agents that are moving around each other very slowly.
- Improved the experimental avoidance quality against non-moving agents by using truncated velocity obstacles.
- Improved the experimental avoidance performance by not generating velocity obstacles for non-moving agent that do not affect the path to the current target.
- Improved the experimental avoidance performance by inlining math.
- Added support to import Unity Offmesh links (Activated, AutoUpdatePositions and Navigation Area properties are ignored). ISignalOnNavMeshWaypointReached is called when reaching a link.
- Added a specific avoidance radius field to the agent configs to be able to use different radii for steering and for avoidance. When selecting the config file in the Editor the value will be initialized with the current agent radius.
- Added region selection to each individual NavMeshAgent that can be changed at run-time: `NavMeshAgent.SetNavMeshRegionActive(1UL << f.Map.GetNavMeshRegionIndex(“Gate001”), false);`
- Added Acceleration field to the NavMeshAgent that can be changed at run-time.
- Added experimental avoidance signals for customization purposes: ISignalOnNavMeshCanAvoid, ISignalOnNavMeshBeforeComputeAvoidance.
- Added an option to disable resetting the agent after OnTargetReached callbacks to prevent invalidating a potential call to SetTarget() during the callback (resetAgent parameter).
- Added an option (LineOfSightFunneling) to the navmesh agent config that tries to remove unnecessary waypoints from the funnel which sometimes occur in conjunction with active regions in the proximity.
- Added an option (WaypointDetectionDistance) to the navmesh agent config that improves the waypoint reached detection for fast-moving or slow-turning agents. For this feature an another additional waypoint (agent starting position) is cached in the navmesh agent.
- Added an option (NavMeshConstants.DebugGizmoSize) to change the navigation gizmo size.
- Added the UpdateInterval setting to the individual navmesh agent config and removing the global one from SimualtionConfig.
- Added mask and layer settings to navmesh agent config to fine-tune avoidance.
- Added Priority, AvoidanceLayer and AvoidanceMask to NavMeshAgent component to make the values changeable at run-time (initial values are set during Agent.Init()).
- Added an option to enable navmesh agent steering and avoidance callbacks individually: SimulationConfig.Agent.EnableCallbacks is split into EnableSteeringCallbacks and EnableAvoidanceCallbacks.
- Added the Steering option `Callback` on each NavMeshAgentConfig to explicitly enable the OnNavMeshUpdateSteering signal for this agent (IgnoreInternalSteering still has to be set). Make sure Agent.CurrentVelocity is always set even if the agent movement is not desired (see the Move By setting).
- Added support to sphere-triangle collision detection when sphere is behind triangle plane.
- Added mesh triangle index info to DynamicHit3D.
- Added FPMatrix4x4 math class to the PhotonDeterministic library.
- Added Transform3D utility math methods.
- Added FPQuaternion.AsEuler (uses the same order of rotations as Unity)
- Added support to offsetting the center of mass on 2D and 3D Dynamic Bodies.
- Added a `Use Manifold Normal` option to 2D and 3D KCC config assets and an optional parameter to kcc methods in order to choose between using the default normal computation or the one from the overlap manifold.
- Added support to minimum linear velocity integration on the 3D Physics. Use the existing 'SimulationConfig.Physics.MinLinearIntegration' field to enable it.
- Added debug log information on exceptions during asset loading.
- Added a utility method to the NavMesh class that helps to move an agent out of invalid navmesh area (MovePositionIntoNavmesh.
- Made NavMesh.FindTriangle() method to get a triangle index at a position public.
- Deprecated FPQuaternion.EulerAngles (for using different order of rotations than Unity)
- Changed MapNavMeshBaker.BakeNavMesh() to accept a parameter object (MapNavMeshBakeData) instead of an MapNavMeshDefinition instance to make it possible to input custom navmesh data without creating a Unity object. Use MapNavMeshDefinition.CreateBakeData() to create a parameter object from the definition.
- Removed UsePhyics option in NavmeshAgentConfig and replaced it with Move Agent By setting. In this manner the movement done by the agent can also be set no do nothing which helps with driving the agent in a custom way.
- Removed useless allocations in the OnInputConfirmed callback.

# 1.2.4.1

## F1 (Stable) (Feb 27, 2020)

- Fixed issues with box-triangle intersection check that was causing collisions to be missed when they were aligned or the triangle was inside the box.
- Fixed an issue with box-triangle collision points calculation that was causing some points to be missed.
- Fixed an issue with the penetration calculation of box-triangle intersection.
- Fixed an issue that clock alias interpolating was not applied to entities with 3D transforms.

- Fixed an issue with the contact point position during triangle-sphere 3D narrow phase detection.
- Fixed an issue with the normal calculation of circle-polygon intersection.
- Fixed an issue with the editor drawer of 2D static colliders that did not take the object rotation into account.

# 1.2.4

**Major Features:**

Filters: it is now possible to define custom entity filters in the DSL files. Filters will result in iterators over active entities that match the desired composition of components.

**Breaking Changes:**

A NavMesh re-import and re-bake is required for all existing navmesh assets due to internal changes to data structures.

A Map re-bake is required because of new data structures used for 3D physics.

Extended the signature of NavMesh methods by INavMeshRegionMask which is implemented by the Frame class.

Removed NavMeshAgentConfig.ProximityFactor and replaced it with an absolute AvoidanceRange.

Changed the signature of the QuantumGameCallbacks.InputConfirmedDelegate to remove allocation. The allocation will still occur when input recording is enabled.

**Known Issues:**

If using 3D physics on mobile platforms, these are the minimum Unity and runtime versions required:

- IL2CPP builds: Unity 2017.2 and up.
- Mono builds: Unity 2018.1+ and runtime 4.x (3D physics will fail with 3.5 mobile mono builds).

Re-bake all maps to correctly initialize new data structures.

## F1 (Stable) (Dec 13, 2019)

- **Breaking Change:** Re-baking all NavMeshes is required.
- Fixed an issue with NavMeshAgent.SetTarget() when the target position is exactly lying on a triangle edge.
- Fixed an issue with validating NavMeshAgent start and target positions when using regions and multiple navmeshes in one map.

- Fixed an issue in EntityPreviewUpdater that caused exceptions when Prefab is set to null.
- Fixed an issue when baking Quantum Animations using the Exit state which is now replaced by the default state.
- Fixed an issue with 3D BoxBox narrow phase collision checks that would ignore the collision if one box would be fully inside the other.
- Fixed an issue that would cause 3D manifolds initial pool to be empty (would allocate on first use fine).
- Fixed an issue with 3D Shape Overlaps where normals where not always pointing towards the shape being tested.
- Changed Quantum animation baking to stop and throw an error when detecting states without a motion clip.
- Changed NavMeshAgent.MaxSpeed to be public which can be used to change the agent speed at run-time.

- Fixed DebugDraw.Rectangle() gizmo rendering for QUANTUM_XY.
- Fixed GizmoUtils.DrawGizmoPolygon2D() to correctly draw polygon normals when the transform/matrix has scaling information. The normals of a QuantumStaticPolygonCollider2D are only drawn when the GameObject is selected.
- Added the automatic generation of QuantumAOT.cs (by the quantum.codegen.unity tool) which fixes issues when deserializing the DB under IL2CPP (check out the Asset Linking manual how to disable it).
- Added an optional QuantumRunner.StartGame signature (String, StartParameters) that uses StartParameters.PlayerCount and StartParameters.LocalPlayerCount to support multiple local players joining an online game.
- Added a virtual ApplyTransform() method to EntityPrefabRoot.cs so developers can override and apply their interpolation without modifying the original script.
- Added an info box in SimulationConfig inspector to warn about an active AutoLoadSceneFromMap toggle (when moving towards a custom way of starting the Quantum simulation this option can cause problems with reloading scenes that are tricky to debug).
- MapData is now saving references to the collider source scripts/GameObjects it used to bake Quantum colliders from. Associating source and baked data was only possible by changing the baking script.
- Changed the interpolation methods in EntityPrefabRoot.cs to use more verbose parameters and make EntityPrefabViewUpdater.cs follow this pattern: always use clock aliasing interpolation except during forced teleports, use error based interpolation only in online games.
- Changed internal methods in CustomEditorsHelper.cs to be public.
- Changed FPVector2.CalculatePolygonCentroid() so it will throw an ArgumentException instead of a DivideByZeroException when passing invalid polygons.

- Added surface normal to 3D Raycast/Linecast (when this option is not disabled).
- Changed the upgrade/quantum_unity.zip file to also contain Unity meta files.

**Beta Status Disclaimer**

B2 was expected to be the last Beta version before moving to RC (release candidate) status. However, we decided to add one new feature and one internal refactoring that would break the semantics of an RC version (meaning we should keep changes to a minimum, focusing on bug-fixes only).

For this reason, B3 is being released as a short-term beta as a preview to the RC version. We expect to give access to the RC version in a short time.

## B3 (Beta) (Oct 22, 2019)

- **Breaking Change:** Removed unused data (Region) from the NavMeshVertex data structure. Please, re-bake all your maps.
- Added support for rectangular map sizes by replacing Gridsize with GridsizeX and GridsizeY. The original variable was kept to make sure serialized maps will load properly. Modifying X and Y directly overwrites the original single size.

- Added a public property to set DeltaTimeType in `QuantumRunner` (was private).
- Added an option to prevent Session.Update() being called in QuantumRunner (OverrideUpdateSession).
- Added an option to improve the NavMesh baking time (`Generating Triangle Center Grid` in particular): Select SpiralOut as the `Closest Triangle Calculation` mode on the NavMesh inspector.

- Fixed an issue in ray-edge collision checks.
- Fixed an issue with the new interpolator when instantiating new prefabs near the origin.

- Fixed an issue on the server plugin input replacements in which max-predict-distance would be observed in all situations.
- Fixed an issue in which server predicted inputs not correctly cloning data arrays could lead to desyncs on late joins.
- Improved Kinematic Character Controller 3D performance.
- Improved NavMeshAgent performance.
- Improved initial synchronized clock value to not be affected by scene loading, frame initialization and user callbacks.
- Improved broadphase initialization cell checks to reuse Manifolds from the pool, avoiding heap allocations.

- Removed the usage of Quantum.Log from map and navmesh baking scripts.
- Removed the spamming “Starting from tick” messages during snapshot reconnects.

## B2 (Beta) (Aug 13, 2019)

- Fixed an issue when detecting intersection between circle and segment (LineIntersectsCircleManifold)
- Fixed an issue where the EntityPrefabViewUpdater was instantiating a prefab at a truncated 3D position (noticeable on trail renderers).
- Fixed an issue where static collision callbacks with triangles and 2D edges could be duplicated in one tick (against the same static).
- Fixed an issue where the DB can cause a checksum error for different system locale.
- Added an option to enable multithreading for NavMesh agent steering, avoidance and pathfinding (SimulationConfig.NavMeshAgent.IsMultithreaded). Be careful when using this with navigation callbacks as only the local entity can be modified during the callback.
- Added an option to toggle the grid rendering: MapData.DrawGridMode and change its color: QuantumEditorSettings.GridColor.
- Added DrawGizmoVector()/Diamond() methods to GizmoUtils.
- Added AngleBetween() method to FPMath to simplify computing the angle delta between two unwrapped angles.

- Removing allocations in QuantumGame.PlayerIsLocal() by writing out the Linq function.

## B1 (Beta) (July 17, 2019)

- Fixed compilation errors in the quantum.systems project when compiling with higher .Net versions. #83

ECS internals:

- Changed internal entity management meta-data to a double linked list. Now entity Create/Destroy are guaranteed optimal O(1) asymptotic performance, while iterators (including filters) are guaranteed optimal O(n) asymptotic performance (where n is the number of active matching entities).

Physics:

- Added friction and bounciness combine functions to physics material asset (legacy, max, min, average and multiply). #91
- Added option to Map to export 2D static polygon colliders as individual edges (better collision performance). #75
- Added relative point to AddForce and a new AddTorque method to DynamicBody3D.
- Added Unity Terrain exporter to 3D Physics. #75
- Added StaticMeshCollider3D for static meshes to be exported to Map; #75
- Added a Kinematic Character Controller (KCC) component, including pre-build steering and jumping, or optional raw callbacks.
- Added [Serializable] attribute to Transform2D and Transform3D components.
- Added static collider getters to Map.cs.
- Added FirstHitOnly to DynamicScene3D.LinecastOptions (this optimizes long raycasts/linecasts when only the first hit is needed).
- Fixed an issue with inverted normals on type-safe collision callbacks due to C# lambdas used on reciprocal narrow phase check functions. # 87
- Fixed an issue with DynamicHits/DynamicHits3D.Sort() method that was allocating data on heap (replaced Array.Sort with a custom quicksort).

Navmesh:

- Fixed a bug that could lead to strange waypoints due to vertex normals not being generated correctly.
- Fixed a bug that could lead to bad paths due to borders generated in wrong places when using Unity navmesh import.
- Fixed an issue with loading the binary navmesh file with an empty DB AssetPath on Standalone
- Optimized the navmesh import and baking performance.
- Added dynamically toggleable navmesh regions.
- Added a funneling step after finding a path to improve the visual path quality (see NavmeshAgentConfig.PathQuality).
- Added a LineOfSight method that generates the closest hit position (towards p0).
- Added another FindClosestTriangle method that searches surrounding grid cells for a closest position *on* the navmesh.
- Added run-time debug rendering of the Quantum navmesh (see QuantumEditorSettings.DrawNavMesh).
- Added a callback when the agent cannot find a path (see INavMeshCallbacks.OnSeachFailed). The agent gets automatically deactivated when this happens.
- The navmesh definition GameObject translation will now affect the baking of the navmesh triangle positions and the rendering gizmo.

Navmesh Agent:

- Removed UpdateInterval from NavMeshSteeringData, instead get the value from Frame.SimulationConfig.NavMeshAgent.UpdateInterval.
- Fixed a bug that could lead to overshooting the angular rotation when agent avoidance was kicking in causing the agents looking direction to jitter.
- Fixed a bug that could make the agent go faster than its max speed for one frame.
- Improved the generation of the fallback triangle cell lookup.
- Fixed the math how agents avoidance force is applied: now added to the desired velocity of the agents and also influences its speed.
- Added NavMeshAgent.InternalTarget which is the corrected Target position (to prevent triggering a repath when setting the same target every tick when the target is corrected).
- Added an optional border check when validating agent targets outside the navmesh which is more accurate than the default validation:  NavMeshAgentConfig.FindValidTargetCellRange. Range 1 will evaluate all cells surrounding the origin position for example.
- Exposed agent repath timeout value. Repathing is forced between waypoints in this interval: NavMeshAgentConfig.MaxRepathTimeout (seconds).
- Added the option to disable breaking on waypoints (NavMeshAgentConfig.BreakingOnWaypoint).
- Added an experimental new agent avoidance system which requires more computations but yields much better visual results (toggle off SimulationConfig.UseLegacyAvoidance to test). The agent priority is flipped for this setting and works similar to Unitys priority (lower value -> higher priority).
- Added a public getter for Waypoints.
- Added NavMeshAgent.Init(config) method. Use this when creating the agent instead of just assigning the config.
- Added AgentConfig parameter LineOfSightWaypointRange to enable LineOfSight checks when getting close to a waypoint. This helps in some cases if many agents tend to clutter around waypoints.

Unity:

- Fixed rendering of physics layers on the SimulationConfig inspector for Unity 2018.3+
- Fixed the radius of DebugDraw Circle and Sphere gizmo rendering (was always drawing half the size).
- Added a new error-based interpolator to EntityPrefabRoot. #98

- Added a data-driven quit behaviour to QuantumNetworkCommunicator.cs: decide between LeaveRoom (default), LeaveRoomAndBecomeInactive and Disconnect.
- Added a data-driven way to chose the client id when starting the game from the demo menus, instead of creating a new GUID every time (Qauntum.Examples.ClientIdProvider). Using the same id will result in getting the same Quantum player slot after reconnecting to a running session.
- Added another version number to Quantum SDK version showing the build number: 1.2.4.X
- Added import physics layers from 2D or 3D options to the SimulationConfig inspector. #84
- Added a Unity Editor menu entry to open the Quantum simulation (Assets/Open Quantum Project), change the sln-path in QuantumEditorSettings.QuantumProjectPath.
- Changed the usages of Photon.LeaveRoom() in the demo menus to always pass “false”, indicating to leave the room immediately, instead of becoming inactive.

Asset Generation:

- Fixed the menu order of generated asset scripts to be alphabetically on three layers Assets->Physics->NavMeshAgent for example. When adding a custom one you can use this `order = (X * 26 * 26) + (Y * 26) + (Z))` where XYZ are Quantum/**A**ssets/**P**hysics/**N**avMesh Agent Config alphabet positions (A = 0).
- Added an option to override the asset name shown in the Unity Editor create asset menu: [AssetObjectConfig(CustomCreateAssetMenuName=””)]
- Added an option to override the asset menu order in the Unity Editor create asset menu: [AssetObjectConfig(CustomCreateAssetMenuOrder=66)]
- Added an option to override the asset script generation destination folder by creating an app config file in the `tools\codegen_unity` folder (see Asset Linking manual).

# 1.2.3

**Breaking Changes:**
 
The way quantum emits array of primitive types defined in the DSL has changed.
It now emits a fixed size buffer public fixed Int32 IntegerDataProperty[8]; instead of the previous field list and array accessor method.

Added an option to enable and disable the 2D verticality feature completely: SimulationConfig.UseVerticalTransform. Default is false. #34

Changed the signature of custom steering callback data object to supply more information about the current state of the agent: replaced normalized Direction by Waypoint, 
added FP braking factor (based on turn angle for waypoint), added Boolean IsTarget (in case waypoint is agent target position).

## F3 (Stable) (Aug 08, 2019)

- Added optimized input encoding/decoding to improve server plugin scalability.

## RC2 (Feb 06, 2019)

**Major Features:**

Replaced the _active boolean on entities with a _flags field instead, currently available flags are: Active, DestroyPending and Culled. 
The ‘IsActive’ property has been deprecated and marked as obsolete but retains its old behavior. You should instead use the new ‘Flags’ property to query the flags of an entity. 

When an entity is scheduled for destruction at the end of frame via a call to DestroyEntity() or Destroy*EntityType*() the DestroyPending flag will be set.

The GetAll*EntityType*() and GetAll*ComponentType*() methods will by default not return entities scheduled for destruction anymore. 
If your code depends on the old behavior of returning all entities you can set ‘#pragma legacy_entity_active_semantics 1’ in the DSL.

Implemented a prediction culling system for when quantum is running in ‘Expose Verified Status In Simulation’ mode.   
Prediction culling has to be explicitly enabled in the simulation config by toggling the `Use Prediction Area` setting on.

Prediction culling allows you to not run the prediction simulation for entities or parts of the simulation which are not inside an area that’s needed to provide 
an accurate visual representation of the game for the local client.

- Added a getter for EntityRef.Index.
- Added an option to use unscaled delta time when updating the simulation and renamed SimulationConfig.UseEngineDeltaTime to SimulationUpdateTime
- Added the [Flags] attribute to physics enumerations OverlapOptions and LinecastOptions.
- Added the FP version of ClosestPointOnTriangle (in FPCollision).
- Added the system callback ISignalOnNavMeshUpdateAvoidance to overwrite Quantum internal avoidance system.
- Added checks to session startup to make sure that you don’t create a quantum game with more player slots than configured in the DSL.
- Added mapping between Quantum player index and Photon actor id via the methods PlayerToActorId, ActorIdToFirstPlayer, ActorIdToAllPlayers on Frame.
- Added proper exception logging to plugin.
- Added Serialize() overloads for FP, FPVector2, FPVector3 and FPQuaternion to BitStream.
- Added prediction culling system when ‘Expose Verified Status In Simulation’ is enabled.
- Removed the _active boolean on Entity and replaced it with a _flags field instead.
- Added implicit cast operators from String and AssetObject to AssetLink.
- Fixed an issue in PUN 1.93 that caused the RTT values to not be set when running against a local server.
- Fixed an issue that caused a hiccup on late joining players during a buddy snaphost reconnect by adding the InitialTick parameter to the Join method.
- Fixed an issue that caused an exception in the Quantum state inspector.
- Fixed an issue in the NavMesh steering callback that could lead to stale data on the parameter object.
- Fixed an Unity 2018.1.* API compatibility issue (PrefabUtility.GetCorrespondingObjectFromSource).
- Fixed issue with code generation for bitsets with a size of less than 32.
- Fixed issue with constant resolution in #pragma definitions.
- Fixed issue in input deserialization on null or zero length predicted inputs which could cause more rollbacks than necessary.
- Fixed issue in plugin where the player slots count would be locked to the photon room size instead of pulling the value from the quantum configuration.
- Fixed an issue when quantum was running in local mode which would cause one input skips when calling SendPlayerData or SendCommand.
- Fixed an issue with Command serialization which would cause all commands to serialize all values to their defaults.
- Fixed an issue where EntityTypeSelector would throw exception on an invalid entity type string.
- Fixed an issue in the AutoMap scene that failed to start the game when only one MapAsset is found.

## RC1 (Jan 24, 2019)

- Upgraded PUN to version to 1.93 (this is required to support the raised size limits for RuntimePlayer and the new Deterministic Commands API). This version of PUN also adds official support for Unity 2018.3.
- Added DeterministicCommands API for easier communication from Unity into the Quantum simulation, see the online documentation for more details.
- Improved the serialization used for sending inputs from server to client making it much more bandwidth efficient.
- Input serializer now uses the same bit packing serialization as the game state serializer.
- Added #pragma auto_input_serializer 0 (DSL) which allows you to override the default input serializer by declaring a partial method called UserSerialize in the Input struct.
- Added the option of enabling fixed size input, this stops quantum from writing the size of the input data to the byte stream when sending input from server to client (DeterministicInput.FixedSizeInput).
- Added DeterministicSession.Resync to enable session recovery from a DeterministicFrame snapshot (requires the use of DeterministicSession.PrepareForResync to be called before the custom snapshot data is request).
- Added the system callback ISignalOnNavMeshUpdateSteering to overwrite the Quantum internal navmesh agent steering. See the "Navigation System" online documentation for more details. #60
- Added an option to use Unity.deltaTime to update the simulation (SimulationConfig.UseEngineDeltaTime). Activating this will make the simulation not catch up after pausing the Editor for example and it also can smooth out any view movement/animation you are drivin from the simulation callbacks.
- Changed the OnUpdateView callback invocation so it is guaranteed to be called every rendered frame. Under some circumstances it was omitted which could lead to stutters in the view rendering (see line above).
- Added inlining attribute to Quantum math function (only takes effect when the simulation runs in .Net, e.g. via the console-runner).
- Added an animation speed variable to the Quantum animator component to control the playback speed during run-time. Default speed is 1. #63

- Added "immediate" parameter to Quantum.Runner.ShutdownAll() to delay the actual destruction of the session until Session.Update() has finished, which fixes errors that occur when calling this from a Quantum event for example. #42 
- Added a virtual Reset() method to the AssetBase class and generate Reset() code to automatically set a valid guid when creating new assets. #45
- Added a visual improvement to the AssetBaseEditor (Quantum Asset Inspector) to make Quantum asset data clearly distinguishable from Unity data on Quantum assets.
- Added a plus button to the AssetLinkDrawer when no asset is linked that creates a new asset file of the linked type in the DB root folder. #46
- Added an optional invoke order to the MapBake-callbacks: [MapDataBakerCallback(100)]. #44
- Added a new Unity scene (MenuAuto.unity) that utilizes the PUN utility script ConnectAndJoinRandom to automatically create, join a room and start the Quantum game. Caveat: sometimes simultanously started apps do not connect to the same room due to a known race-condition.
- Added focus on selected vertices function to the manual NavMesh editing tool (pressing F key).
- Added the NavMesh manual editing tool feature "Duplicate And Flip" to the undo stack.
- Added visual improvements to the NavMesh editor: drawing edges when "Toggle Draw Mesh" is active, added a progress bar to "Import From Unity".
- Added a toggle to the MapNavMeshDefinition script that optimizes the gizmo rendering performance (does not work when editing the NavMesh manually).
- When starting the simulation on a client from your own snapshot and sending InitialTick with the Join message, the server only sends you relevant inputs back.
- Fixed an issue with the internal job system that degraded performance on Android devices when using the physics multi-threading option. #36
- Fixed an issue when running the simulation on the server where shared broadphase data in the physics engine was causing interference between game instances. Broadphase data is now stored on the FrameContext.
- Fixed an issue that could cause errors on the client when the Join message is delayed or other messages are send during the Quantum game start routine.
- Fixed an issue that could corrupt the FPAnimationCurve drawer data when having multiple curve objects on one asset.
- Fixed the performance of map grid gizmo rendering.
- Fixed the "asset missing" label visibility that is shown on-top of AssetLinks in the Unity Inspector.
- Fixed issues with the Quantum Animator when using a 1D blend tree that imported false weights and could cause an divide-by-zero exception. #65
- Fixed an issue that would send non-optimal clock adjusting for late joins.
- Fixed an issue that reconnecting players did not get the same player id when using the same clientId during QuantumRunner.StartGame().
- Fixed an issue in the plugin that caused unnecessary input cancellations after snapshot-based reconnects.

# 1.2.2

# 1.2.0

**Breaking Change:**

The online session startup procedure changed. Now there's no need to set RuntimePlayer object in advance (RuntimeConfig doesn't have a Players array anymore).
RuntimePlayer instances for the local players may now be set assynchronously at runtime as long as there's a deterministic session running.
See migration_notes.txt on the upgrade folder for more details.

Important: The network protocol of 1.2.0 is incompatible with previous versions. This means
you have to update your backend plugin after you've upgraded to client SDK 1.2.0.

- Added runtime version checking between client SDK and photon server plugin when creating/joining a session.
- Improved memory use for static broadphase data (physics 2D, physics 3D and navmesh agents).
- Fixed an issue where dynamic box or polygon collision could cause a desync because of stale runtime data during predict/rollbacks.
- Fixed an issue in the polygon-polygon collision code that could result in faulty penetration calculation.

# 1.1.8 hotfix

- Added the option to flip the event invoke order, define QUANTUM_FLIP_EVENT_ORDER in the unity Script Define Symbols and the events will be invoked in the order they are raised.
- Fixed an issue with events raised in OnInit and OnEnable during startup were not invoked.
- Fixed an issue in background thread mode where you could sometimes miss event callbacks and verified frames if the game was running too slow.
- Fixed an issue where dynamic box or polygon collision could cause a desync because of stale runtime data during predict/rollbacks.
- Fixed an issue in the polygon-polygon collision code that could result in faulty penetration calculation.

# 1.1.8

**Breaking Change**

The Quantum.EntityTypes enum is now 1-indexed instead of 0-indexed, this is done so that
default(EntityRef) does not resolve to a valid entity. Most likely this will not affect anyone
but if you had a Quantum.EntityTypes enum field on a MonoBehaviour or other asset serialized in
Unity it will no longer have the correct value.

- Lowered memory usage of physics engine and navmesh.
- Improved error message when adding an asset with duplicate guids during runtime.
- Improved accuracy of initial clock synchronization during game startup.
- NavMeshAgent avoidance now influences agent rotation.
- Type specific EntityRef's now throw a System.InvalidCastException instead of System.Exception upon casting error.

- Added 'asset import <SubClassAsset>' syntax for importing non root-assets into the DSL.
- Added NavMeshAgent debug draw configuration option.
- Fixed an issue in the code generator where an asset_ref<T> that was only used inside an array would not get generated.
- Fixed an issue with the IL patcher where it would not be possible to debug-step into the quantum.state dll.
- Fixed an issue where casting default(EntityRef) to an type-specific entity ref would throw an exception.
- Fixed an issue inside of the code generator relating to the type safe collision signals that would lead to a compile error.

# 1.

- Added support for statically typed collision signals for entities.
- Added support for time dilation in the client to slow down time if one of the clients cant keep up (off by default).

**Breaking Change:**

The collision signal API has been reworked, we now provide four signal interfaces:

ISignalOnCollisionDynamic
ISignalOnCollisionStatic
ISignalOnTriggerDynamic
ISignalOnTriggerStatic

Any code that previously used the ISignalOnCollision interface needs to be updated to 
use either ISignalOnCollisionDynamic or ISignalOnCollisionStatic instead.

**Breaking Change:**

StaticTriggerData struct has been renamed to StaticColliderData.

**Breaking Change:**

In the inspector for the quantum static colliders in Unity the field named 'Trigger Asset' has been renamed to 
just 'Asset' as it's now available for non-trigger collisions with static colliders also.

**Breaking Change:**

Trigger callbacks are now invoked for these cases also:

- Added On<EntityType>Created and On<EntityType>Destroy signal which are invoked whenever an entity of <EntityType> is created or destroyed.
- Added setting 'Expose Verified Status In Simulation' which allows you to query the Frame.IsVerified and Frame.IsPredicted state inside the simulation.
